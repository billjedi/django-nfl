An App to contain some NFL data so you can do whatever you feel
like with it.

I use it for a pickem pool just for fun with some family and friends.

Because the season doesn't change (much) we make use of caching when
getting common things like teams and the schedule for a week, etc...

NOTE: This is a work in progress... it's not functional or useful now.
